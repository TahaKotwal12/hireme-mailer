Dear {hr_name},

I hope this message finds you well.

My name is Taha Kotwal, and I am a passionate and self-motivated Software Engineer with hands-on experience in developing scalable backend systems and full-stack applications using technologies such as Python (FastAPI), Spring Boot (WebFlux), React, and PostgreSQL. I am currently working at Cyber Manager Software Services, where I actively contribute to the development of SaaS-based services following modern software engineering principles and microservices architecture.

I am writing to express my strong interest in exploring software development opportunities at {company_name}. I bring a growth-oriented mindset, a deep interest in solving real-world problems, and a strong foundation in clean code, agile workflows, and collaborative team dynamics.

I am open to **relocating internationally** and can **join immediately** if the opportunity aligns. I truly value diverse teams and global collaboration, and I am confident in my ability to adapt quickly and contribute meaningfully.

Attached is my resume for your review. I would be grateful for the opportunity to connect and further discuss how my experience and aspirations align with your teamâ€™s needs.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Warm regards,  
Taha Kotwal
